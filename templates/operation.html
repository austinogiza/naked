                   The conversion of dc to alternating voltage is achieved by converting energy stored in the dc source
                   such as the battery, or from a rectifier output, into an alternating voltage. This is done using
                   switching devices which are continuously turned on and off, and then stepping up using the
                   transformer. Although there are some configurations which do not use a transformer, these are not
                   widely used. <br>
                   The DC input voltage is switched on and off by the power devices such as MOSFETs or power transistors
                   and the pulses fed to the primary side of the transformer. <br> The varying voltage in the primary induces
                   an alternating voltage at secondary winding. The transformer also works as an amplifier where it
                   increases the output voltage at a ratio determined by the turnâ€™s ratio. In most cases the output
                   voltage is raised from the standard 12 volts supplied by the batteries to either 120 Volts or 240
                   volts AC.

                       The inverters are classified according to their output waveforms with the three common types
                       being the square wave, the pure sine wave and the modified sine wave. <br>
                       The square wave is simple and cheaper, however, it has a low power quality compared to the other
                       two.<br> The modified square wave provides a better power quality (THD~ 45%) and is suitable for
                       most
                       electronic equipment.<br> These have rectangular pulses that have dead spots between the positive
                       half cycle and the negative half cycle (THD about 24%).
