                        depends on the early choices you make, right from the very beginning.

                    <p class="mt-2">We arrive at the site location with materials and a team of smiling installers and
                        electricians.

                        Home installations usually take a day, we begin and complete the entire process in one day,
                        except for special circumstances. <br>

                        Business Installations can take a little longer, depending on the complexity of your site.

                        We use state of the art equipments to carry out installations, when needed, we use scaffolding,
                        and this is erected one day before the installation day, and removed no latter than a day after.
                        <br>

                        The installation process is done with minimal disruption, your power is only off for a few
                        minutes, we have a team of polite installers and usually clean up after work.
